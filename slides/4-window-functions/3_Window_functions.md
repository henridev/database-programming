# 3. Window Functions

dit komt aan bod bij SQL examen = open boek slides zijn te gebruiken

> A window function performs a *calculation across a set of table rows* that are *somehow related to the current row*. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function *does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row* â€” the *rows retain their separate identities*. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

> window = ordered subset of data over which calculations are made => usualy defined by `ORDER BY` and `PARITTION BY` after `OVER` clause

## 3.1 introduction

- mogelijk gebruik is vergelijken huidige tov vorige verkoop
- CTE => with component | WF => over clause

## 3.2 OVER clause

- makes partition of `SELECT` result
- per partition there are numbering ordering and aggregate functions
- `OVER` creates the *partitions* and *ordering*
- paritition = window shifting over the data
- `OVER` is usable with usual aggregate functions (sum, avg ...) or specific window functions (range, lag ...)

### 3.2.1 example: running total

```SQL
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock
FROM Products
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId
```

solution 1: Correlated Subquery

```SQL
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
    (
        SELECT SUM(UnitsInStock)
        FROM Products
        WHERE CategoryID = p.CategoryID
        AND ProductID <= p.ProductID
    ) as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId
```

> the problem with this is it's inefficiency as it calculates the sum for each row

solution 2: Over clause

- we gaan de sum doen in de volgorde category, product en voor de partitie product.
- parititie bepaalt wanneer resetten
- volgorde in de order by is de volgorde waaring geteld wordt
- stel we laten de parititie weg dan zal gewoon doorgeteld worden
- order by bepaald in welke volgorde er opgeteld zal worden

```SQL
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	-- take the sum of units in stock over the entire result set in order by category id and product id
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID) 
	as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId

SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	-- each sum will simply be sum of all within the partition = what the end value would be if order by was used
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID) 
	as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId

SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	-- take the sum of units in stock over the set partitioned by category id in order by category id and product id
	-- within each category take the running total 
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID) 
	as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId

-- in volgorde van product id stock samentellen
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (ORDER BY ProductID) 
	as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY ProductId
```

we can also use other aggregate functions besides sum

```SQL
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID) 
	as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory,
	
	AVG(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID) 
	as AvgUnitsInStockPerCategory,

	COUNT(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID) 
	as CounUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId
```

> this solution is more efficient as it calculates the sum for each partition
> partities zijn een optie maar order by zijn verlplicht

## 3.3 RANGE

3.2 is syntax sugar that leaves out `RANGE`

```SQL
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	SUM(UnitsInStock) OVER 
	RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
	as TotalUnitsInStockPerCategory
FROM Products p
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId
```

er zijn andere opties voor unbounded preceding and current row

```SQL
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
```

### 3.3.1 Example

```SQL
SELECT CategoryID, ProductID, UnitsInStock,
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID
    -- vorige tot huidige = cumulatief
    RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as sumPrecCurr,
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID
    -- huidige tot opvolgende
    RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as sumCurrFol,
	SUM(UnitsInStock) 
	OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY CategoryID, ProductID
    -- vorige vorige tot opvolgende = category totaal
    RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as sumPrecFol
FROM Products p
WHERE ProductId < 15
ORDER BY CategoryId, ProductId
```

| CategoryID | ProductID | UnitsInStock | sumPrecCurr | sumCurrFol | sumPrecFol |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1          | 1         | 39           | 39          | 56         | 56         |

| 2          | 3         | 13           | 13          | 192        | 192        |

| 8          | 10        | 31           | 31          | 55         | 55         |
| 8          | 13        | 24           | 55          | 24         | 55         |

## 3.4 ROWS

- while for `RANGE` current row is compared to other row based on `ORDER BY` predicate
- if you want a physical offset however you should use `ROWS`

```SQL
-- vb sales per maand en vorige sales als voorbije 3 maand
ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND N FOLLOWING
RANGE BETWEEN N PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
```

```SQL
SELECT 
	EmployeeID, 
	LastName + ' ' + FirstName as 'Name',
	Salary,
	AVG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN  2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as AvgSalary2Preceding
	-- OR
	-- AVG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN  CURRENT ROW AND 1 FOLLOWING) as AvgSalary2Following
	-- OR
	-- AVG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN  1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) as AvgSalary1Preceding2Following
FROM Northwind.dbo.Employees;
```

## 3.5 FUNCTIES WITH WINDOW FUNCTIONS

- `ROW_NUMBER()` => sequential number of a row within a partition (number rows in sequence 1,2,3,4,5)
- `RANK()` => rank of row within the partition = one + 1 plus ranks before the row (same number for ties 1,2,2,4,5 <- registreerd de gelijke stand)
- `DENSE_RANK()` =>  returns the rank of each row within the  partition of a result set, with no gaps in the ranking values (1,2,2,3,4)
- `PCT_RANK())` => ranking on 0-1 scale

```SQL
SELECT 
	EmployeeID, 
	LastName + ' ' + FirstName as 'Name',
	Title,
	Salary,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'ROW_NUMBER',
	RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'RANK',
	DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'DENSE_RANK',
	PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'PERCENT_RANK'
FROM Northwind.dbo.Employees;

SELECT 
	EmployeeID, 
	LastName + ' ' + FirstName as 'Name',
	Title,
	Salary,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY TITLE ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'ROW_NUMBER',
	RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY TITLE  ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'RANK',
	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY TITLE ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'DENSE_RANK',
	PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY TITLE ORDER BY Salary DESC) as 'PERCENT_RANK'
FROM Northwind.dbo.Employees;
